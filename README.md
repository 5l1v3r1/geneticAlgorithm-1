# geneticAlgorithm-1
Application of a Genetic Algorithm to the "Infinite monkey theorem"

## Run
`python3 main.py`

## Info
I wrote this python code in a Linux environment, it might not work with Windows.

Feel free to play with this code and to criticize my work by giving me advice. Just please don't be rude.

## Tips
Resize your terminal window to a pretty big size, output is going to occupy a lot of space.

Daniel Shiffman and his amazing "The Nature of Code" (chapter 9) book!
